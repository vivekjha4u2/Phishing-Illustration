What is Phishing?
> Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data,
including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker,
masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, text message.

This project is just to illustrate that it is simple to get your sensitive information
if you are not enough smart.
